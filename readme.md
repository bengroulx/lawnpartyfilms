This marketing website is for Devon Mussett, filmmaker. The site runs on Kirby,
a flat-file CMS that works on PHP 5.4+, Apache, or Nginx. It doesn‚Äôt require a
database, which makes it easy to ‚Äúinstall‚Äù: just copy Kirby's files to your
local server (i.e. MAMP/WAMP or other) and visit it in a browser.

More info about Kirby can be found at <https://getkirby.com/docs> and
<https://getkirby.com/support>.
