## Installation
**Kirby** is a flat-file CMS that runs on PHP 5.4+, Apache or Nginx. It does not
require a database, which makes it easy to “install”: just copy Kirby's files to
your local server (i.e. MAMP/WAMP or other) and visit the URL for the site in
the browser.

1. Run it from the command line: `php -S localhost:8000`
2. Go to `localhost:8000` in your browser

**When moving files, check if the invisible .htaccess file has been copied to
your server correctly**
